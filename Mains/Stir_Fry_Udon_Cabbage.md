* Remove cabbage to udon bowl and toss
* Wipe out pan

### Stir Fry - Meat

* Add a bit more coconut oil and heat the pan at med-hi
* Drop in pork - _do not stir initially_
* Allow pork to brown on one side, flip and repeat browning on the other
* Break up pork and cook through until there's no pink (~1 min)
* Add aromatics, stirring ~1 min
* Add sauce, and cabbage + udon bowl, stirring to coat everything in everything
* Remove from heat, garnish with seasame seeds & green parts of scallions if you like, and serve
