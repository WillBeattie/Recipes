# Eggplant Kuku

From Ottolenghi's _Plenty More_. A very weird texture but quite enjoyable if you approach with an open mind :)  He
doesn't call for brining the eggplant, but if I try to fry them without brining it just turns to mush.

Don't skip the barberries!  Crucial, both visually and for flavour
