# Pork Wellington aka Pork Log

From Alton Brown's _Good Eats_ episode _Tender is the Pork_

There are many variations for fillings and herbs: his uses dried apples and thyme. It's fine to freestyle a little

## Prep

* Preheat oven to 400 F

### Team Meat Log
* Lay out a piece of parchment paper, ~12x16"
* One by one, place the prosciutto pieces on the parchment vertically, with a ~1/2" overlap between each piece.  This should eventually form a rectangle about as wide as your tenderloin is long
* Place a second piece of parchment paper on top of the prosciutto rectangle, then use a rolling pin to flatten out the sandwich, helping the prosciutto strips to adhere to each other
* Remove the top parchment layer
* Sprinkle the prosciutto with salt, pepper, and your herb of choice
* Take your tenderloin that you've split lengthwise and flip around one half so they line up head to tail, making each end roughly the same thickness
* Place that tenderloin assembly and place it in the middle of your prosciutto rectangle
* Spread your dried fruit in between the tenderloin pieces and push the halves back together
* Using the parchment to assist, wrap the prosciutto rectangel around the tenderloin to cover it completely - slowly peeling back the bottom parchment as you go helps a lot here

### Team Final Wrap
* Lightly flour your work surface
* If needed, roll the pastry out to 12x14" size (the grocery store ones are already a little too big - you can trim if you need to)
* Spread your mustard in the middle of your pastry sheet, staying ~1" away from the edges
* Place the assembled meat log in the middle of the pastry
* Fold the pastry over the log then roll the assembly forward to fully enclose the pork
* When you've got ~1-2" of pastry left, brush the exposed pastry with your egg+water wash (this helps the pastry stick to itself)
* Pinch the ends of the pastry and turn the whole schebang seam-side down

## Cooking
* Line baking sheet with parchment paper
* Place bread roll on sheet, with the puff-pastry seam side down
* Brush all exposed pastry with your egg-wash solution
* Lightly sprinkle coarse salt on top
* Bake for 25-30 min or until golden brown
* Remove from oven and let stand minimum 5 minutes
* Cut with serrated bread knife
