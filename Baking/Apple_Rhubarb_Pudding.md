## Prep
* Preheat oven at 325 F
### Crust
* Blend butter and dark brown sugar in food processor, 2 min, scraping down sides as you go
* Add ground almond and egg
* Process for 4-5 more minutes, or until the batter is fully smooth

### Filling
* Mix all filling ingredients in large bowl
### Assembly
* Transfer the filling mix into a ~7in diameter baking dish
* Press down firmly to compact the mash
* Pour the crust batter over top, smoothing with a spatula

## Cooking
Bake uncovered until the crust has reached your desired shade of brown, ~ 2 hrs.  The crust will puff up a little and look very attractive but it will collapse after cooling.  C'est la vie.  Serve with yogurt if you like.
