## Prep
### Blanch
* Boil a large pot of water
* Blanch the beets for 3-5 minutes, until they're softer but still have a little bit of crunch
* Drain, rinse under cold water, then spread out and pat dry with paper towel

### Marinade
* Mix the team marinade ingredients in a big bowl with a bit of salt and pepper if you like
* Add the beets (making sure they're nice and dry), toss to coat
* Let sit for ~15 minutes

### Final Assembly
* Add all the remaining ingredients to the bowl
* Toss lightly (you don't want the beets to bleed and make everything completely red if you can avoid it)
* Serve
